                        Edson's article "Dark Matter" explores how the vast interworkings of the internet are often
                        forgotten and too often underutilized. Much like how 90% of the interworkings of the universe
                        are made up of invisible dark matter, our modern internet infrastructure and content
                        platforms are built by too often invisible people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a Computer Science student, I have great admiration for all the unthanked and often unnamed
                        contributors to FOSS (free open source software) and projects designed to help others. Many
                        people don't
                        realize that it's entirely possible to use the internet without spending any money. This is
                        thanks to
                        people such as Linus
                        Torvalds, the inventor of Linux, a FOSS OS competitor to MAC and Windows. People like
                        Linus have
                        designed FOSS competitors for nearly every major software out there. For example, GIMP is a free
                        alternative to Photoshop, Libre software is a suite of apps that compete with Microsoft Office,
                        and Mozilla Firefox is a FOSS web browser. As a computer science student, the majority of
                        programming languages, coding software, and development tools I use are designed and maintained
                        for free for users to learn. These people are often funded by donations.
                        Other programs such as Java implement a free-to-users,
                        expensive-for-businesses software model that enables anyone to learn and use the software while
                        still providing funding for upkeep and maintenance for Java developers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Edson reminds me of a new perspective, similar to the unnamed developers and programmers out
                        there are
                        all the artists, internet historians, and content creators. These people are contributors to the
                        sum of human creativity
                        and knowledge; they teach others and create spaces outside of capitalism. And yet, they won't
                        receive the accolades they deserve. As Tim Oâ€™Reilly puts it capitalism measures "value captured,
                        not value created."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Edson goes on to argue that our museums and intellectual institutions are behind the times
                        on their digital prowess. They lack the openness that many artists and developers have tried to
                        push for on the internet. And they fail to utilize digital media in ways that could enable more
                        open access to art, culture, and knowledge. One way institutions can grow is by accepting help
                        from the people who offer it. There are plenty out there who would gladly revamp websites and
                        code apps for museums if just given the chance. Perhaps museums and intellectual institutions
                        such as colleges would benefit from reaching out and partnering with others for technological
                        help.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's perhaps important to mention the ways that some institutions are using the
                        internet to its fullest. Monterey Bay Aquarium, for example, offers live cameras of some of
                        their
                        exhibits online for anyone to view. They also run a Tumblr blog that interacts with the
                        community, increasing awareness for events. Or some parks such as Central Park
                        run Twitters that share information on their history and increase community engagement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of course, no amount of outside partnerships and asking for funding on GoFundMe and Patreon will
                        ever replace
                        adequately funding our cultural institutions. With the money that current institutions have it
                        is still increasingly
                        important, and beneficial, to invest in digital outreach. Now the largest
                        audiences ever can be
                        reached online. And while it may not be the same as going to a museum, there must be a way to
                        interact with and enjoy
                        institutional culture online.

                        Ian Milligan's "History in the Age of Abundance?" examines a lot of interesting ideas in the
                        first chapter. In this blog post I wanted
                        to explore more about how the growing body of historical born digital data has to grapple with
                        increasingly more "black boxes" of bias.
                        In the digital era, many of our daily activities are automated behind complex algorithms without
                        easily understandable methodologies.
                        For example, a Google Search weighs in all of a user's previous searches, their location and
                        advertising profile, as well as history and
                        information from friends and family, when deciding which search results to return to a user. Our
                        increasingly complex world has not moved
                        on from the biases of history, technology has often only hidden them behind user-friendly
                        disguises.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another example of black boxes in the digital age is anything and everything to do with Machine
                        Learning. Specifically neural networks. These algorithms
                        use complex mathematics to learn to minimize an error function. With a enough data a neural
                        network can learn to do whatever task it is assigned.
                        Some AI's classify complex data into categories, such as a handwriting recognition device.
                        Others are used to make decisions when given lots of
                        interconnected data, such as which road to take given the current traffic, or which financial
                        applicants qualify for a bank loan. In many of these examples bias
                        is easily countered or identified, Google Maps uses an AI to determine your route but since
                        route data isn't racist, it would be very hard to make a racist mapping AI.
                        However, in the bank loan example, or in examples that involve making hiring and firing
                        decisions, or AI's that choose how to curate information, racism is incredibly hard to avoid.
                        Unless the data used to train an AI is perfectly unbiased, the AI will be biased as well. This
                        is a terrible problem in the AI world as the interworkings of
                        an artificial intelligence are purely mathematical, they are a "black box," without explanation
                        or qualifiers to their answers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ian Milligan recognizes that's there's bias in every time period, every policy and every
                        decision made. Our algorithms are necessarily going to be biased as well.
                        Computer Scientists now are tasked with developing methods for reducing bias in AI's and almost
                        as importantly, developing tools for explaining why an AI does what it does.
                        Historians as well work towards eliminating bias in their work, by developing
                        more inclusive policies, and more empathetic decision making.
                        When developing tools for web scraping and archival we must approach the practice with the same
                        intent. While we cannot remove bias altogether, scientists
                        can make conscientious deciscions about which websites get archived and who's voice is heard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In our increasingly interconnected world it becomes more important to recognize our own biases
                        and the biases around us.
                        As scientists we have the tools and resources to build a better and more inclusive world, and
                        must strive to do so. Only by addressing our biases and developing tools and methodologies to
                        counteract them can we document our world most accurately.
