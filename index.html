                        Edson's article "Dark Matter" explores how the vast interworkings of the internet are often
                        forgotten and too often underutilized. Much like how 90% of the interworkings of the universe
                        are made up of invisible dark matter, our modern internet infrastructure and content
                        platforms are built by too often invisible people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a Computer Science student, I have great admiration for all the unthanked and often unnamed
                        contributors to FOSS (free open source software) and projects designed to help others. Many
                        people don't
                        realize that it's entirely possible to use the internet without spending any money. This is
                        thanks to
                        people such as Linus
                        Torvalds, the inventor of Linux, a FOSS OS competitor to MAC and Windows. People like
                        Linus have
                        designed FOSS competitors for nearly every major software out there. For example, GIMP is a free
                        alternative to Photoshop, Libre software is a suite of apps that compete with Microsoft Office,
                        and Mozilla Firefox is a FOSS web browser. As a computer science student, the majority of
                        programming languages, coding software, and development tools I use are designed and maintained
                        for free for users to learn. These people are often funded by donations.
                        Other programs such as Java implement a free-to-users,
                        expensive-for-businesses software model that enables anyone to learn and use the software while
                        still providing funding for upkeep and maintenance for Java developers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Edson reminds me of a new perspective, similar to the unnamed developers and programmers out
                        there are
                        all the artists, internet historians, and content creators. These people are contributors to the
                        sum of human creativity
                        and knowledge; they teach others and create spaces outside of capitalism. And yet, they won't
                        receive the accolades they deserve. As Tim Oâ€™Reilly puts it capitalism measures "value captured,
                        not value created."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Edson goes on to argue that our museums and intellectual institutions are behind the times
                        on their digital prowess. They lack the openness that many artists and developers have tried to
                        push for on the internet. And they fail to utilize digital media in ways that could enable more
                        open access to art, culture, and knowledge. One way institutions can grow is by accepting help
                        from the people who offer it. There are plenty out there who would gladly revamp websites and
                        code apps for museums if just given the chance. Perhaps museums and intellectual institutions
                        such as colleges would benefit from reaching out and partnering with others for technological
                        help.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's perhaps important to mention the ways that some institutions are using the
                        internet to its fullest. Monterey Bay Aquarium, for example, offers live cameras of some of
                        their
                        exhibits online for anyone to view. They also run a Tumblr blog that interacts with the
                        community, increasing awareness for events. Or some parks such as Central Park
                        run Twitters that share information on their history and increase community engagement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of course, no amount of outside partnerships and asking for funding on GoFundMe and Patreon will
                        ever replace
                        adequately funding our cultural institutions. With the money that current institutions have it
                        is still increasingly
                        important, and beneficial, to invest in digital outreach. Now the largest
                        audiences ever can be
                        reached online. And while it may not be the same as going to a museum, there must be a way to
                        interact with and enjoy
                        institutional culture online.
